**Amber Rimell's test outcomes:**

According to the **16 Personalities** test, I am a Defender (ISFJ-A). I read through the results and found them to be quite accurate.

The **“What’s Your Learning Style?”** test has shown that I am a Visual learner. I agree. I picture words and images in my head, and repeat them to make sure they stick in my memory. I also like to type or write things out to make sure I’m really taking all the information in.
This shows that I am better at text conversations than I am at talking. I like to re-read conversations and info as needed.

The **DISC Personality** test results state that I am - in order of most to least: Steady, Compliant, Influential, Dominant. They say that ‘You are determined to achieve objectives. You are a clear thinker. You like to pursue a definite course of action. You respond to logic rather than emotion.’. I very much agree with these statements.
This shows that I like to get things done in a concise manner and have a clear path ahead. I am happy to follow but also feel comfortable leading.
